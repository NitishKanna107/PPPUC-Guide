# Programming Principles and Practices Using C++ - Bjarne Stroustrap
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and drills in the book PPPUC++.

## About
I have been into programming since I was in middle school and C++ was the very first programming language I was introduced to. In 2020, being stuck at home, I decided to pass time by learning programming rather than binge watching crap on TV. I decided to learn C++ first as I read on a lot of online forums that it would help me get a firm foundation in programming. The very first C++ resource I used for my learning was the website called Codecademy. It offered an interactive learning approach where you would be taught a concept and immediately given an exercise to test your knowledge. I felt it was a fun and practical way to learn programming so, I stuck till the end and finished the course. 

I explored C++ further by learning about OpenGL (graphics library), Git (I tried developing my own version of git with C++), and by developing console applications. In around two years I developed a strong liking toward C++ and decided to venture really deep into it. The book PPPUC++ came in at the right time when I needed to sharpen and strengthen the concepts of C++.

## How you can benefit from this repository
While practicing the exercises of the book I felt the need to crosscheck and verify my solutions. I found Bjarne's website where he had published the solutions to a few selective exercises from the book and used it as a reference. But still his website didn't cover all of the exercises and left out the drills so, I searched GitHub for resources and was surprised to find out that many people had uploaded well documented solutions and even a free online copy of the book. 

I made it a routine to first solve the exercise on my own and then compare the solution to somebody else's uploaded on GitHub. This gave me the opportunity to learn different approaches to a problem, and also feel superior when my solution felt better than theirs. Consequently, I felt inspired to upload my solutions too on GitHub and as a side effect it made sure that I completed every single exercise without skipping any.

> I couldn't properly organize the solutions for Chapters 1-7 as I created this repository only after I had gone through them. Sorry for the inconvenience but I have listed alternate resources at the end.

## Compilers and IDE
I personally prefer Visual Studio as it is a comprehensive IDE and has all tools built into it. If you want to find a good place to start then Visual Studio is not a bad choice but I would recommend that you also experiment with others until you feel comfortable with one.

The header files used such as std_lib_facilities.h can found here:

List of IDE and compilers you can start with:
- Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Dev C++ (https://www.bloodshed.net/)
- Turbo C (https://turbo-c.net/)
- GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## My review of the book
I haven't yet finished reading it completely (I am on chapter 8) but still I can confidently say that this is the best C++ resource I have ever come across. If you are just a beginner or have some experience with C++ but need to sharpen skills then I would definitely recommend that you get yourself a nice long lasting hardcover version of this book. Seriously, you won't ever regret investing your time on this book as the return on investment in phenomenal.

## Feedback
I am always to open to constructive feedback and would much appreciate it if you could point out improvements in my code. The main reason I made this repository is to give the readers and myself a feel of community. So, feel free to learn new ways to code and grow your knowledge.
